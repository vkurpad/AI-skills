# AI-skills
This repository is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks for AI skills. The repository is intended to build out enrichment skills that are either document enrichment skills or corpus level enrichment skills. 

The document enrichment skills should be able to plug into the cognitive search skillset in Azure Search. The corpus skills should work with the Knowledge store on the Azure Search service. Each of these skills can be tested out using Binder. When ready to use, deploy to an Azure Container Instace or Azure Function.
